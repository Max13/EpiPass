      <p>Hi <strong>unknown !</strong></p>
      <p>
	Seems to be your first visit...?<br />
	Or not, if you've deleted you account.
      </p>
      <p>
	So, EpiPass Manager is an Epitech password manager.<br />
	Think about it, you know all your passwords. A day you come at Epitech ans see "Please enter UID" on the door... What's that shit ?? I don't know, neither...
      </p>
      <p>
	But, something I know, it that if you saved your passwords on your mobile, you wouldn't have to worry again about forgetting your sheet at home !<br />
	Again, don't worry about your passwords, they're written locally with LocalStorage (By Javascript) and will never be transferred anywhere, so don't even fear any packet tracer =D
